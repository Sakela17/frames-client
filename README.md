When scheduling for multiple shifts, multiple employees over multiple divergent time zones, 
Frames steps in to take out the leg work. Users can easily add, assign, edit and delete shifts, 
maintain a list of employees and contact information and keep their schedules straight in daily, 
weekly or monthly views.

## Motivation
This project was built in 3 weeks with 3 other fellow students from the Engineering Immersion program at 
[Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/atlanta/). We practiced daily standups and SCRUM meetings with 
our Team Lead, used [Trello](https://trello.com) as a project management tool, alternated the roles to let 
everyone to contribute to both the server and the client code. But most importantly, we had a lof of fun 
building this application!
